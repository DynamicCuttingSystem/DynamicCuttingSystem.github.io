# Fabrication
<div style="text-align: justify">The prototype frame is almost entirely constructed out of pine wood because itâ€™s light weight, durable and cheap. The more load heavy components such as for the yoke mechanism are made of aluminum in order to withstand higher forces. The cylindrical components such as the conveyor rollers and the turntable are made of plastic as they are cheap and readily available in the required sizes. Various machines (such as bandsaw, drill press, milling machine, etc.) are used for fabrication. The conveyor belt is made of tablecloth as it is appropriate for the types of loads that need to be transferred (vegetables). In addition, wheels are added to each leg of the frame to help with transportation.</div>
