# Background
<div style="text-align: justify">Cutting vegetables has always taken a long time for us, and we sought to improve the process. Vegetables are cut in bulk at small restaurants, so improving the process for them would allow for a greater efficiency compared to households. Thus, our target consumers became small restaurants. We conducted surveys to understand the problem better. We interviewed 10 restaurants around the UW area and the result we found was:</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">It can be seen from the results that there is a lot of room to improve. Even increasing the speed or decreasing the effort to cut a few of the common vegetables could save the companies a tremendous amout. A lot of solutions already exist for automated cutting but we can bring a unique solution to the table by having vegetable sorting as well, so different types of vegetables can be fed in with the cut slices being sorted in appropriate bins. With this in mind, the problem statement is formulated.</div>

**Problem Statement**  
_Design an automated system that will identify, slice and sort common vegetables (eggplants, zucchinis and cucumbers)._

# Constraints and Criteria
<div style="text-align: justify">Next, a list of constraints and criteria were created to help come up with a good solution.</div>
<table class="table table-condensed table-striped table-hover">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Constraints</th>
